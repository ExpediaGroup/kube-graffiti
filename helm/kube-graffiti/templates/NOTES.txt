kube-graffiti has now been installed as service: -
  {{ if eq .Values.service.name "" -}}
  {{ include "kube-graffiti.fullname" . }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local
  {{ else -}}
  {{ .Values.service.name }}.{{ .Release.Namespace }}.svc.cluster.local
  {{ end -}}

Please use kubectl to check which mutatingwebhookconfigurations have added to your cluster, e.g.
  $ kubectl get mutatingwebhookconfigurations

You should have a webhook 'add-name-label-to-namespaces' by default
or one for each graffiti rule that you configured via your values.

If you have not created your own kube-graffiti certificates
(you can use the script https://github.com/HotelsDotCom/kube-graffiti/blob/master/testing/gencerts.sh)
please make sure that you deployed the chart into the namespace 'kube-graffiti'.
